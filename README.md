# AragonDanielle_DijkstraAlgorithm_Graph
This Java code implements Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path in a weighted graph. It defines classes for vertices, edges, and a graph. The DijkstraAlgorithm class computes the shortest path. The main function demonstrates creating a graph and printing the shortest path between specified vertices.
